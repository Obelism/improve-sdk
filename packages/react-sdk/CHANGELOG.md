### Major Changes

- 9da3160: Decouple analytics events from tests (test-independent event stream + exposures).

  **Breaking.** Attribution moves from write time to read time. Events are now
  recorded once per visitor, test-independently, and the server attributes them to
  whichever tests/flags the visitor was exposed to. This enables sharing events
  across tests/flags, flag analytics, and an org-wide event overview.

  - **`postAnalytic` is now global**: the signature drops the leading `testSlug`
    argument — `postAnalytic(event, payload?)` instead of
    `postAnalytic(testSlug, event, payload?)`. An event is emitted once per
    page/session (deduped by event name) and carries no test/variant.
  - **`usePostAnalytic()` takes no arguments** and returns
    `(event, payload?) => …`. Update call sites from
    `usePostAnalytic(slug)` → `usePostAnalytic()`.
  - **Automatic exposure beacons**: `getTestValue` / `getFlagValue` now emit an
    exposure beacon the first time they resolve a non-holdout variant for a
    visitor (audience-excluded and allocation-holdout visitors are not exposed).
    This is what the server joins against to attribute events, so **a visitor must
    read their variant (`useTestValue` / `getTestValue`) for their events to
    count** — the old implicit "first tracked event = exposure" behavior is gone.
  - **Beacon contract**: `POST /api/log` bodies are now discriminated by
    `type: 'event' | 'exposure'`; the event body no longer includes
    `testId`/`testValue`. Requires the matching server release (hard cutover — old
    beacons are rejected).
  - The mirrored GTM dataLayer entry's `improve` object no longer includes
    `test` / `variant`, only `visitorId`.

### Minor Changes

- 2af02c9: Rich analytics payloads and GA4 / GTM event-name alignment.

  - **Structured `postAnalytic` payload**: the third argument now accepts a `{ value, currency, message, params }` object (GA4-style) in addition to the previous plain `message` string, which still works as a shorthand for `{ message }`. Pass a `value` (with `currency`) on your conversion event to unlock **revenue and average order value per variant**; `params` (e.g. a GA4 `ecommerce` object) is stored and mirrored to the GTM dataLayer.
  - **GTM dataLayer ecommerce**: `value`, `currency`, and any `params` ride along on the mirrored dataLayer entry, and passing a GA4 `ecommerce` object first pushes `{ ecommerce: null }` to clear the previous one (GA4-recommended reset).
  - **Event-name conventions**: new `ImproveEventName` / `ImproveRecommendedEventName` types offer the GA4 recommended names (`add_to_cart`, `purchase`, …) as autocomplete while still accepting any string. `postAnalytic` warns in development (once per name) when an event isn't `snake_case`; silence all SDK warnings with the new `disableWarnings` setup option. Event names in the reserved `gtm.*` namespace are ignored.
  - **Contract hardening**: `currency` is capped to the backend's 8-char limit, an invalid (non-object / array) `params` is dropped instead of failing the whole event, and an over-8KB payload warns before the backend would reject it — so a large `params` doesn't silently lose the event.
  - **Config types**: `ImproveEvents` gains an optional `funnel` (ordered funnel steps) to match the datafile.
  - The React `usePostAnalytic` hook accepts the same structured payload and `ImproveEventName` typing.
